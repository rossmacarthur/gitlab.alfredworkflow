## Features

- Uses the GitLab GraphQL API to list issues and merge requests for a project.
  - Open the issue or merge request in your browser.
  - Use **â‡§** to instead copy the URL to clipboard.
- Configure as many projects as you want.
- Caching of API requests for responsiveness.
- Blazingly fast ðŸ¤¸ (it's built in Rust ðŸ¦€).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Pre-packaged

Grab the latest release from
[the releases page](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/gitlab.alfredworkflow/releases).

Because the release contains an executable binary later versions of macOS will
mark it as untrusted and Alfred won't be able to execute it. You can run the
following to explicitly trust the release before installing to Alfred.
```sh
xattr -c ~/Downloads/gitlab-*-apple-darwin.alfredworkflow
```

### Building from source

This workflow is written in Rust, so to install it from source you will first
need to install Rust and Cargo using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Then install
[powerpack](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/powerpack). Then you can run the
following to build an `.alfredworkflow` file.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rossmacarthur/gitlab.alfredworkflow.git
cd gitlab.alfredworkflow
powerpack package
```

The release will be available at `target/workflow/gitlab.alfredworkflow`.

## Configuration

### Authentication

You will need to add a `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable which you can create
using [this link](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens?name=gitlab.alfredworkflow&scopes=read_api).
It only needs the `read_api` permission.

### Commands

Any environment variable prefixed with `GITLAB_ISSUES_` or
`GITLAB_MERGE_REQUESTS_` defines a workflow command that will list the issues
or merge requests for the provided project respectively. The name of the command
should follow the prefix. For example to get the command to list issues on the
iTerm2 repository like in the screenshot above you would set the following
environment variable.

| Name                 | Value           |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| GITLAB_ISSUES_ITERM2 | gnachman/iterm2 |

You can specify as many commands as you want.
